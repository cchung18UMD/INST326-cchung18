Week 1
I did not use AI this week. I did, however, use ChatGPT last week to ask about the small yellow objects that appeared on one of my tomato plants (they appeared to be aphids), and I might use it again to ask it more questions about my tomatoes again.

Week 2
I asked ChatGPT to find a show I had forgotten the name of by giving it details of the show that I remember. Sadly it could not find the show.
